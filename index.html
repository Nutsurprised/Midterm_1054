<title>Cats Vs Dogs</title>

<h1>Cats are Better</h1>
<p>Cats are great animals to have, they are low maintenance, independent and fluffy. While they don't like to be touched whenever the owner pleases, they certainly are animals that want affection. If you rub them by the chin and around their neck, you can expect a happy cat that will come back for more. Cats are low maintence, they don't need to be walked twice a day, they know how to take care of themselves by using their own litter box. They love to play.
    Cats don't need to be groomed as much as dogs, as they lick themselves all over and keep clean that way. It's possible to walk your cat outside with a leash, however, it's going to require some training. Afterall, cats don't like to be tied down and want to roam around as freely as they choose. 
    Also, cats come in different shapes and sizes, with different personalities like dogs. Unlike dogs, they aren't loud and just meow. I love cats, they are cute, fluffy and they rock. </p>

<h1>Dogs rock</h1>
<p>Dogs are very smart and intelligent, and they can serve many roles! From a family pet to a protective guardian, or employed as a service dog to help someone in need. Service dogs can perform many tasks, such as therapeutic purposes, helping someone who is blind and needs a guide dog, or who has seizures and needs someone to be able to get help and alert others around them. There are dogs who work on farms, assisting the handicapped, and helping the police and military. There are many types of dogs and they all have different purposes that are beneficial to us. Dogs have incredible senses of smell, and hearing which they are known for. They can sniff out bombs, find a missing person, track down criminals and more! I think my favorite saying Iâ€™ve heard is that dogs are basically four-legged crime fighters! Try seeing if your cat would ever save your life!</p>
