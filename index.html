<h1>Dogs rock</h1>
<p>Dogs are very smart and intelligent, and they can serve many roles! From a family pet to a protective guardian, or employed as a service dog to help someone in need. Service dogs can perform many tasks, such as therapeutic purposes, helping someone who is blind and needs a guide dog, or who has seizures and needs someone to be able to get help and alert others around them. There are dogs who work on farms, assisting the handicapped, and helping the police and military. There are many types of dogs and they all have different purposes that are beneficial to us. Dogs have incredible senses of smell, and hearing which they are known for. They can sniff out bombs, find a missing person, track down criminals and more! I think my favorite saying Iâ€™ve heard is that dogs are basically four-legged crime fighters! Try seeing if your cat would ever save your life!</p>
